## A Little Bit About Me 👀

I'm a web development technician with a strong interest in **building solid, well-structured applications** using modern technologies.  
I enjoy the process as much as the result: thinking, designing, refactoring, breaking things, fixing them, and learning why they broke in the first place.

I’m especially interested in:
- Front-end & back-end development  
- Clean architecture & maintainable code  
- Learning how real-world software is built
